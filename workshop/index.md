The focus of our PROSE Organizing Workshop, 2023 June 12-16 at the [University of South Alabama](https://www.southalabama.edu/), is to bring the community together to develop a shared vision and plan to establish a managing organization for the [PreTeXt-Runestone Open Source Ecosystem](../) (PROSE). This organization would serve the communities around PreTeXt XML language and software products for authoring open-source STEM textbooks, and Runestone courseware for hosting these books as part of a powerful Learning Engineering Analytics Portal.

This workshop will include a variety of stakeholders across the ecosystem: instructors, authors, researchers, publishers, and developers. It can often be hard to see the forest for the trees, and we need voices from all corners of our community in order to envision the sustainable infrastructure (both human and technological) we need to build to support the creation, distribution, use, and study of the next generation of high quality and evidence-based STEM Open Educational Resources. 

This workshop will generally follow the [AIM model](https://aimath.org/workshops/about/). Leaders in the community will be asked to give presentations each morning on how the ecosystem is supporting them currently, and how they feel it could grow to serve more scholars. Each afternoon we will form working groups in order to have targeted discussion on various topics related to the ecosystem. A major goal of the workshop is to provide community consensus on topics related to our upcoming [NSF POSE Phase II](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23556/nsf23556.htm) proposal that will provide the funding to make these plans a reality.

We have funding from the NSF to support around thirty participants. We have sent invitations to several stakeholders from all corners of the PreTeXt-Runestone ecosystem asking for their availability, but are seeking applications from other participants who can help us scope our open-source ecosystem. Applications from persons underrepresented in STEM OER initiatives are especially encouraged. We also need the participation of everyone necessary for the health of our ecosystem: instructors, authors, researchers, publishers, and developers.
