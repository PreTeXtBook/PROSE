The focus of our PROSE Organizing Workshop, 2023 June 12-16 at the [University of South Alabama](https://www.southalabama.edu/), is to bring the community together to develop a shared vision and plan to establish a managing organization for the [PreTeXt-Runestone Open Source Ecosystem](../) (PROSE). This organization would serve the communities around PreTeXt XML language and software products for authoring open-source STEM textbooks, and Runestone courseware for hosting these books as part of a powerful Learning Engineering Analytics Portal.

This workshop will include a variety of stakeholders across the ecosystem: instructors, authors, researchers, publishers, and developers. It can often be hard to see the forest for the trees, and we need voices from all corners of our community in order to envision the sustainable infrastructure (both human and technological) we need to build to support the creation, distribution, use, and study of the next generation of high quality and evidence-based STEM Open Educational Resources. 

This workshop will generally follow the [AIM model](https://aimath.org/workshops/about/). Leaders in the community will be asked to give presentations each morning on how the ecosystem is supporting them currently, and how they feel it could grow to serve more scholars. Each afternoon we will form working groups in order to have targeted discussion on various topics related to the ecosystem. A major goal of the workshop is to provide community consensus on topics related to our upcoming [NSF POSE Phase II](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23556/nsf23556.htm) proposal that will provide the funding to make these plans a reality.

- We do not have funding for additional in-person participants at this time.

## Workshop Details and Schedule

Official activities will take place between 9am-4pm Monday-Thursday, and 9am-12noon on Friday, at the [University of South Alabama Faculty Club](https://www.southalabama.edu/departments/mitchellcenter/facultyclub/). 

Virtual participants will receive information via email on how to connect via Zoom.

The Mobile area is served by both Lyft and Uber which are typically available for incoming flights to the MOB airport; previous visitors to the University of South Alabama have reported good experiences using the "Derek's Taxi" car service (251-654-2817) to schedule rides in advance.

Funded in-person participants have a reservation at the [Homewood Suites by Hilton Mobile Airport-University Area](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/mobpphw-homewood-suites-mobile-airport-university-area/). Airfare/mileage will be reimbursed after the workshop concludes. Breakfast is provided at the hotel, and several meals during the workshop will be catered; actual costs for other meals can also be reimbursed without receipts (up to a daily maximum which will depend on the final costs of the provided food).

\* Participants who drink alcoholic beverages are asked to contribute a $10 cover for the Welcome Reception on Sunday and the Banquet Dinner on Wednesday. This will cover the cost of assorted beer and wine provided at the reception, and the cost of a bartender to offer beer, wine, and spirits for purchase (credit card only) at the banquet dinner. There is no cover for participants who do not wish to drink alcohol at these events as the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages is covered by our workshop funding.
