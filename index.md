PROSE is a project scoping the development of an Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) surrounding [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org)
and [Runestone](https://runestone.academy) software products supporting the authoring and publishing of
[Open Educational Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) in STEM. Through a series of
virtual and in-person roundtable discussions, office hours, and [workshops](./workshop.html), we will engage instructors, authors,
publishers, and researchers using these products to develop a vision and strategic plan for our OSE.

<blockquote style="font-size:0.8em;text-align:justify">Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) educational materials that are open-sourced and made freely available to learners and educators, known as Open Educational Resources (OER), require an infrastructure that exceeds the quality of commercial alternatives. This project scopes the creation of an Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) consisting of two existing open-source products: PreTeXt for authoring scholarly documents and textbooks suitable for all areas of STEM, and the Runestone learning engineering and analytics portal for publishing OER textbooks that support both instruction and education research in K-12 and higher education. The long-term societal impacts of this OSE are open-source textbooks that are made freely available to the nation’s STEM classrooms and students through the Open-Source Ecosystem’s support of instructors, authors, and researchers. Furthermore, the OER has the potential to reflect cutting-edge advancements in STEM education research by removing the barriers between researchers, authors, instructors, and students. PreTeXt-authored works can be converted into HTML, print, and braille formats, enabling the resulting Open Educational Resources to be accessible to a wide range of learners at no cost, an equitable approach to ensuring that all students have the same access to education.</blockquote>
