What makes an educational product "open source"? While the web allows
for the easy posting and dissemination of educational products, there
are additional considerations that creators should be aware of in order
to maximize the impact and sustainability of their products, particularly
for works that aim to serve a wide audience and require ongoing maintenance.

This guide is a community service provided by
[the PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy) to our ecosystem of
creators who wish to produce free and open-source digital products for
the benefit of STEM education, and should not be considered to be legal advice.
This guide may include information that is specific to the United States.

## Why not just post my work online?

A core [principle of the PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy)
is the mission to "collaborate on a flexible platform that incorporates new innovations".
In particular, we envision a future where community members are able to create high-quality 
educational products that are not locked into any particular format or vendor, and are made
available to the world's students and educators at no cost. Furthermore, these works
should be available for other creators to remix and redistribute as part of future 
educational innovations, as well as for scholars to leverage as part of their educational
research programs.

To that end, we encourage our community members to not only make their works
available online, but to explicitly **open-license** and **open-source** their works
using **open platforms**.

### Open Licensing and Copyright

When you create an educational product, either you or your employer owns the
**copyright** on that **intellectual property (IP)**.

Often, faculty at academic
institutions retain ownership of the intellectual property they create, unless this
IP was created as a requirement of their official duties, such as part of an externally
sponsored grant. This may vary by organization and the type of IP created (e.g. software
may have different rules); your faculty handbook may have more information.

Either way, the copyright owner may choose to apply an open **license** on this IP that
allows non-owners to use this property for their own purposes.

### Open Source

### Open Platforms

## Two Major Kinds of Educational Products

Broadly speaking, the corpus of educational products includes two major categories:
**documents** and **software**.
