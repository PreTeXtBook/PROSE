What makes an educational product "open source"? While the web allows
for the easy posting and dissemination of educational products, there
are additional considerations that creators should be aware of in order
to maximize the impact and sustainability of their products, particularly
for works that aim to serve a wide audience and require ongoing maintenance.

This guide is a community service provided by
[the PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy) to our ecosystem of
creators who wish to produce free and open-source digital products for
the benefit of STEM education, and should not be considered to be legal advice.
This guide may include information that is specific to the United States.

## Why not just post my work online?

A core [principle of the PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy)
is the mission to "collaborate on a flexible platform that incorporates new innovations".
In particular, we envision a future where community members are able to create high-quality 
educational products that are not locked into any particular format or vendor, and are made
available to the world's students and educators at no cost. Furthermore, these works
should be available for other creators to remix and redistribute as part of future 
educational innovations, as well as for scholars to leverage as part of their educational
research programs.

*Simply making your work available somewhere online does not clearly communicate to
students and teachers that they have the right to use your work or archive/redistribute
your work in case it becomes unavailable later. It also does not facilitate community
investment in your product, as there is no mechanism for co-creators to build upon
your product, or contribute improvements back to you.*

To that end, we encourage our community members to not only make their works
available online, but to explicitly **open-license** and **open-source** their works
using **open platforms**.

### Open Licensing and Copyright

When you create an educational product, either you or your employer owns the
**copyright** on that **intellectual property (IP)**.

Often, faculty at academic
institutions retain ownership of the intellectual property they create, unless this
IP was created as a requirement of their official duties, such as part of an externally
sponsored grant. This may vary by organization and the type of IP created (e.g. software
may have different rules); your faculty handbook may have more information.

Either way, the copyright owner may choose to apply a **license** on this IP that
allows non-owners to use this property for their own purposes. Examples of specific licenses
we suggest (depending on the product) are below, but in general, an **open license** is
one that provides the public the right to use, remix, and redistribute IP, modulo
some requirements such as attribution of the original author.

An open license provides the public the *legal* right to use your work, but in order
to give them a *practical* ability to do so, creators must also consider open source
and open platforms.

### Open Source

While it is possible to open-license a complete product and make this finalized work
available to the public, this is not enough for the product to be considered **open source**.
An open source product not only has its finalized work made available to the public,
but also all the source files and materials necessary to rebuild this finalized work.
As a simple example, an author may make their textbook available as a PDF under an open
license, but without also distributing the source text/Word/LaTeX document that was used
to create this PDF, they have impeded the practical ability of other creators to create
derivative works. This means not only that typos stay typos, but it may end up easier 
for other creators to "reinvent the wheel" rather than use the create materials you've
already developed.

Open-sourcing your work can be as simple as hosting the source files for a product
alongside the finished work, but creators that adopt version control systems such as
[Git/GitHub](https://g4m.clontz.org) benefit from tooling that not only dissiminates
their source code, but also provides co-creators mechanisms to contribute back their
edits, communicate about the development of the open-source work, and so on.

### Open Platforms and Vendors

A final consideration for open-source educational resources are the platforms and vendors
used to create, distribute, and implement these works in the classroom. This is particularly
important in an era with many freely-available websites that not only host educational
resources, but allow for the creation and dissemination of new educational works. However,
if these web applications are themselves proprietary, what happens when they add a paywall
restriction, or go offline altogether? While the content creators may retain copyright
over their works built for such a service, and may choose to open-license and open-source those
works, there is little benefit for having a license and source code that's only compatible
with a service that is not available for students or teachers to use in the classroom.

To that end, [the PROSE Consortium](https://prose.runestone.academy)
is dedicated to supporting the creation of educational
technologies and resources that are not locked into any particular platform or vendor,
even our own. By using open-source software to create your educational product,
and disseminating it using open-source services, you are investing in the longevity of
your work and its impact on the broader community of STEM education research and practice.

## Two Major Kinds of Educational Products

Broadly speaking, the corpus of educational products includes two major categories:
**documents** and **software**.
